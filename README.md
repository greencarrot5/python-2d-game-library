# python-2d-game-library
A python library that helps making 2d games.
# description
Python already has a great built-in library for graphics, tkinter, but there aren't many tools to create a 2d game. This library will contain functions to write simple games in a few lines of code.
# goal
The goal is to make it easy for everyone to create 2d games in python, without having to calculate everthing yourself.
